# ðŸ“§ Spam Detection System: Overview

This project focuses on creating a machine learning-based system to identify spam messages using text analysis. It trains a Naive Bayes classifier on a labeled SMS dataset, with text converted to numerical features via TF-IDF vectorization. The system achieves high accuracy in classifying spam and non-spam messages, showcasing the application of machine learning for effective spam filtering.

## ðŸ“‹ Key Details
- **Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
- **Dataset:** Kaggle SMS Spam Collection  
- **Steps:** Data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation  

The project highlights the practical use of machine learning for improving communication safety by automating spam detection.
