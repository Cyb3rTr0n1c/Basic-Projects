# 🔐 Password Strength Checker Project

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a password strength checker to evaluate and improve password security. This tool assesses passwords based on criteria such as length, character variety, common patterns, personal information, and entropy to help users create more secure passwords.

## 📖 Scenario
With increasing cyber threats, ensuring password security is critical. This project involves creating a tool that checks passwords against established security metrics to determine their strength, providing feedback and scores based on different characteristics.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 🛠️ Implementing password strength evaluation techniques
- 🔒 Understanding and applying metrics such as length, character diversity, and entropy
- ⚠️ Identifying common password patterns and personal information vulnerabilities

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 📝 Programming language: Python
- 📚 Libraries for regex and calculations
- 🗃️ Data for common passwords and personal information

## 📝 Steps
1. **🛠️ Define Password Criteria**
   - Establish metrics for evaluating length, character variety, and patterns.

2. **🔍 Implement Common Pattern Detection**
   - Write functions to identify common dictionary words, repetitive sequences, and keyboard patterns.

3. **🧮 Calculate Entropy**
   - Develop a method to measure password randomness and complexity.

4. **📉 Score Based on Criteria**
   - Assign scores for length, variety, and entropy, applying penalties for common patterns.

**Possible Updates:**
- 💡 Provide feedback to guide users in improving their passwords
- 📚 Check against common word lists like rockyou.txt
- 📝 Conduct surveys to avoid using personal details

## 📜 Project Description
This project involves building a password strength checker to help users create secure passwords. It evaluates passwords by analyzing length, character variety, and common patterns, calculates entropy, and provides a strength score. This tool helps users enhance their password security practices.

## 📄 Summary
The password strength checker project successfully developed a tool to evaluate password security based on multiple criteria. It scores passwords on length, diversity, and entropy, and penalizes common patterns and personal information use. The project highlights the importance of strong password practices and provides practical feedback to improve password security.
