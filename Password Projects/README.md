# 🔐 Password Strength Checker Project

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a password strength checker to evaluate and improve password security. This tool assesses passwords based on various criteria, such as length, character variety, common patterns, personal information, and entropy, to help users create more secure passwords.

## 📖 Scenario
In an era of increasing cyber threats, ensuring password security is critical. This project involves creating a tool that checks passwords against established security metrics to determine their strength. The strength checker will provide feedback and scores based on different password characteristics.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 🛠️ Implementing password strength evaluation techniques.
- 🔒 Understanding and applying metrics such as length, character diversity, and entropy.
- ⚠️ Identifying common password patterns and personal information vulnerabilities.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 📝 Programming language (Python) for developing the strength checker.
- 📚 Libraries for handling regular expressions and mathematical calculations.
- 🗃️ Data for common passwords and personal information.

## 📝 Steps
Steps followed to create the password strength checker:

1. **🛠️ Define Password Criteria**
   - Establish metrics for evaluating password length, character variety, and common patterns.

2. **🔍 Implement Common Pattern Detection**
   - Write functions to identify common dictionary words, repetitive sequences, and keyboard patterns.

3. **🧮 Calculate Entropy**
   - Develop a method to calculate the entropy of a password to measure its randomness and complexity.

4. **📉 Score Based on Criteria**
   - Assign scores for password length, character variety, and entropy, while applying penalties for common patterns.

Possible updates.
**💡 Provide Feedback**
   - Implement a feedback system to guide users on improving their passwords based on the evaluation results.
**📚 Check against common word dictionaries**
   - Make a search in different word lists such as rockyou.txt.
**📝 Personal survey**
   - Do a quick survey to avoid the use of personal details when creating the password.
    
## 📜 Project Description
This project involves building a password strength checker to help users create secure passwords. The tool evaluates passwords by analyzing their length, variety of characters, and common patterns. It calculates entropy to assess randomness and provides a score that categorizes the password strength. By implementing this checker, users can enhance their password security practices.

## 📄 Summary
The password strength checker project successfully developed a tool to evaluate password security based on multiple criteria. The tool scores passwords on length, character diversity, and entropy, and penalizes common patterns and personal information usage. This project highlights the importance of strong password practices and provides practical feedback to help users improve their password security.
