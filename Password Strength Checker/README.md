# 🔐 Password Security Projects Repository

This repository focuses on tools and techniques to enhance password security. It includes practical examples and code to improve password strength, detect vulnerabilities, and implement secure practices. Key projects, like the **Password Strength Checker**, demonstrate advanced security metrics and practical solutions for stronger passwords.

## 🔐 Password Strength Checker Project

### 🎯 Objective
Develop a password strength checker to evaluate and improve password security. The tool assesses passwords based on length, character diversity, common patterns, personal information, and entropy, providing feedback to help users create stronger passwords.

### 📋 Key Details
- **Tools:** Python, libraries for regex and calculations  
- **Steps:**
  1. Define password criteria: length, variety, patterns  
  2. Implement pattern detection: dictionary words, sequences  
  3. Calculate entropy for complexity  
  4. Score passwords and provide feedback  

### 📝 Summary
The password strength checker evaluates password security using metrics like length, diversity, and entropy, while penalizing weaknesses like common patterns. It provides actionable feedback to encourage secure password practices, emphasizing the importance of robust password creation.
